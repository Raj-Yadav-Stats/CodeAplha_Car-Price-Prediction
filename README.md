**Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning:**

This project demonstrates how to predict car prices using various machine learning techniques. It is designed with beginner data scientists in mind and follows a clean, step-by-step approach to model development.

**Project Structure:**

Car_Prediction.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook that includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

car_data.csv: The dataset used for training the car price prediction model (ensure this is available in the same directory).

**Dataset:**

The dataset contains information about used cars such as:

1.Car name and model

2.Year of purchase

3.Fuel type

4.Selling price

5.Kilometers driven

6.Number of owners

**Techniques Used:**

Linear Regression Model

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Variables

Train/Test Split

Model Evaluation (RÂ² score, MSE)

**How to Run**

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/Raj-Yadav-Stats/car-price-prediction.git


**Install dependencies:**

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

**Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

jupyter notebook Car_Prediction.ipynb

**Future Improvements:**

Include other models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, or XGBoost.

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Improve EDA with visuals.
